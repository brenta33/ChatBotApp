# Basic info on ChatBot App
## Description of project being done. 
The project being done consists of two main elements, the back end of the chat bot which is handled by an API that sends back the user responses in text form, and user interface or view of the bot as a widget where a user can interact with the bot. The bot has the job to create, modify and delete appointments created by the user. This is in regards to a store, doctor's appointment or any type of appointment a user may need to set up with a service provider. 

## Limitations of project. 
As it stands currently the system is not so smart, users can have different ways of saying things and the system will not capture what the user is trying to say exactly. There is always a fallback message in the case that the bot doesn't understand the user output but, there's many instances where the bot does not understand the input of the user and the user has to figure out ways to make the bot understand what they are trying to say.
